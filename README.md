# IP Address Tracker
A challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">frontendmentor.io</a>
<p>
In this challenge, I used two separate APIs together to create an IP address tracking application. See your own IP address on the map on initial page load and
search for any IP address or domain to see key information and location.
</p>
<p>
To get the IP Address locations, i used the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, LeafletJS.
